# Soundboard

This Python-based soundboard project allows you to play audio through your microphone, creating a customizable and interactive soundboard experience. Easily trigger your favorite sounds or effects in real-time during virtual meetings, live streams, or casual conversations.

## ðŸš€ Get started

To get started download the [`soundboard.zip`](https://github.com/SimonStnn/soundboard/releases/latest/download/soundboard.zip) file from the latest release. After downloading, unzip the file and run `soundboard.exe`.

### Config

You can customize the soundboard to your liking in the config. If you want to keep the default, you can ignore this section.

#### Manually

To manually make the config, rename `config.yaml.template` to `config.yaml` and you're good to go! You can change the values in the config to your liking.

#### Automatically

A copy of the `config.yaml.template` will be made the first time you run the program. Once the `config.yaml` file is made you can make changes and customize the soundboard.
